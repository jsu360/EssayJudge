            Assume you are an IELTS examiner. You need to score the grammatical accuracy in the student's essay.
            Based on the IELTS Writing Task 1 text prompt and image prompt, as well as the student's essay, please assign a score (0-5) according to the criteria in the rubric. The output should be only the score.
            [Rubric]: 
                    5 - Sentence structure is accurate with no grammatical errors; both simple and complex sentences are error-free. 
                    4 - Sentence structure is generally accurate, with occasional minor errors that do not affect understanding; some errors in complex sentence structures. 
                    3 - Few grammatical errors, but more noticeable errors that affect understanding; simple sentences are accurate, but complex sentences frequently contain errors. 
                    2 - Numerous grammatical errors, with sentence structure affecting understanding; simple sentences are occasionally correct, but complex sentences have frequent errors. 
                    1 - A large number of grammatical errors, with sentence structure severely affecting understanding; sentence structure is unstable, and even simple sentences contain mistakes. 
                    0 - Sentence structure is completely incorrect, nonsensical, and difficult to understand.
                    Please output only the number of the score (e.g. 5)ï¼š
