            Assume you are an IELTS examiner. You need to score the coherence in the student's essay.
            Based on the IELTS Writing Task 1 text prompt and image prompt, as well as the student's essay, please assign a score (0â€“5) according to the criteria in the rubric. The output should be only the score.
            [Rubric]:
                    5 - Transitions between sentences are natural, and logical connections flow smoothly; appropriate use of linking words and transitional phrases. 
                    4 - Sentences are generally coherent, with some transitions slightly awkward; linking words are used sparingly but are generally appropriate. 
                    3 - The logical connection between sentences is not smooth, with some sentences jumping or lacking flow; linking words are used insufficiently or inappropriately. 
                    2 - Logical connections are weak, sentence connections are awkward, and linking words are either used too little or excessively. 
                    1 - There is almost no logical connection between sentences, transitions are unnatural, and linking words are very limited or incorrect. 
                    0 - No coherence at all, with logical confusion between sentences.
            Below is the reference content:
            image: "{graph}"
            Essay title: "{question}"
            Student's essay: "{essay}"
