            Assume you are an IELTS examiner. You need to score the lexical diversity in the student's essay.
            Based on the IELTS Writing Task 1 text prompt and image prompt, as well as the student's essay, please assign a score (0-5) according to the criteria in the rubric. The output should be only the score.
            [Rubric]: 
                    5 - Vocabulary is rich and diverse, with a wide range of words used flexibly, avoiding repetition. 
                    4 - Vocabulary diversity is good, with a broad range of word choices, occasional repetition, but overall flexible expression. 
                    3 - Vocabulary diversity is average, with some variety in word choice but limited, with frequent repetition. 
                    2 - Vocabulary is fairly limited, with a lot of repetition and restricted word choice. 
                    1 - Vocabulary is very limited, with frequent repetition and an extremely narrow range of words. 
                    0 - Vocabulary is monotonous, with almost no variation, failing to demonstrate vocabulary diversity.
                    Please output only the number of the score (e.g. 5)ï¼š
