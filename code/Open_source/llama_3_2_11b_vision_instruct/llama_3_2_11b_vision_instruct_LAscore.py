            Assume you are an IELTS examiner. You need to score the lexical accuracy in the student's essay.
            Based on the IELTS Writing Task 1 text prompt and image prompt, as well as the student's essay, please assign a score (0-5) according to the criteria in the rubric. The output should be only the score.
            [Rubric]: 
                    5 - Vocabulary is accurately chosen, with correct meanings and spelling, and minimal errors; words are used precisely to convey the intended meaning. 
                    4 - Vocabulary is generally accurate, with occasional slight meaning errors or minor spelling mistakes, but they do not affect overall understanding; words are fairly precise. 
                    3 - Vocabulary is mostly correct, but frequent minor errors or spelling mistakes affect some expressions; word choice is not fully precise. 
                    2 - Vocabulary is inaccurate, with significant meaning errors and frequent spelling mistakes, affecting understanding. 
                    1 - Vocabulary is severely incorrect, with unclear meanings and noticeable spelling errors, making comprehension difficult. 
                    0 - Vocabulary choice and spelling are completely incorrect, and the intended meaning is unclear or impossible to understand.
                    Please output only the number of the score (e.g. 5)ï¼š
