def GDscore(image_url, question, essay):

            Assume you are an IELTS examiner. You need to score the grammatical diversity in the student's essay.
            Based on the IELTS Writing Task 1 text prompt and image prompt, as well as the student's essay, please assign a score (0–5) according to the criteria in the rubric. The output should be only the score.
            [Rubric]: 
                    5 - Uses a variety of sentence structures, including both simple and complex sentences, with flexible use of clauses and compound sentences, demonstrating rich sentence variation. 
                    4 - Generally uses a variety of sentence structures, with appropriate use of common clauses and compound sentences. Sentence structures vary, though some sentence types lack flexibility. 
                    3 - Uses a variety of sentence structures, but with limited use of complex sentences, which often contain errors. Sentence variation is somewhat restricted. 
                    2 - Sentence structures are simple, primarily relying on simple sentences, with occasional attempts at complex sentences, though errors occur frequently. 
                    1 - Sentence structures are very basic, with almost no complex sentences, and even simple sentences contain errors. 
                    0 - Only uses simple, repetitive sentences with no complex sentences, resulting in rigid sentence structures.

            Essay title: "{question}"
            Student's essay: "{essay}"
