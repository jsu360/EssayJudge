            Assume you are an IELTS examiner. You need to score the persuasiveness of the justifying in the student's essay.
            Based on the IELTS Writing Task 1 text prompt and image prompt, as well as the student's essay, please assign a score (0-5) according to the criteria in the rubric. The output should be only the score.
            [Rubric]:
                    5 - Fully addresses and accurately analyzes all important information in the image and prompt (e.g., data turning points, trends); argumentation is in-depth and logically sound. 
                    4 - Addresses most of the important information in the image and prompt, with reasonable analysis but slight shortcomings; argumentation is generally logical. 
                    3 - Addresses some important information in the image and prompt, but analysis is insufficient; argumentation is somewhat weak. 
                    2 - Mentions a small amount of important information in the image and prompt, with simple or incorrect analysis; there are significant logical issues in the argumentation. 
                    1 - Only briefly mentions important information in the image and prompt or makes clear analytical errors, lacking reasonable reasoning. 
                    0 - Fails to mention key information from the image and prompt, lacks any argumentation, and is logically incoherent.
                    Please output only the number of the score (e.g. 5)ï¼š
