            Assume you are an IELTS examiner. You need to score the punctuation accuracy in the student's essay.
            Based on the IELTS Writing Task 1 text prompt and image prompt, as well as the student's essay, please assign a score (0-5) according to the criteria in the rubric. The output should be only the score.
            [Rubric]: 
                    5 - Punctuation is used correctly throughout, adhering to standard rules with no errors. 
                    4 - Punctuation is mostly correct, with occasional minor errors that do not affect understanding. 
                    3 - Punctuation is generally correct, but there are some noticeable errors that slightly affect understanding. 
                    2 - There are frequent punctuation errors, some of which affect understanding. 
                    1 - Punctuation errors are severe, significantly affecting comprehension. 
                    0 - Punctuation is completely incorrect or barely used, severely hindering understanding.
                    Please output only the number of the score (e.g. 5)ï¼š
