                            Assume you are an IELTS examiner. You need to score the essay length in the student's essay.
                            Based on the IELTS Writing Task 1 text prompt and image prompt, as well as the student's essay, please assign a score (0-5) according to the criteria in the rubric. The output should be only the score.
                            [Rubric]: 
                                    5 - Word count is 150 words or more, with the content being substantial and without obvious excess or brevity. 
                                    4 - Word count is around 150 words, but slightly off (within 10 words), and the content is complete. 
                                    3 - Word count is noticeably too short or too long, and the content is not sufficiently substantial or is somewhat lengthy. 
                                    2 - Word count deviates significantly, failing to fully cover the requirements of the prompt. 
                                    1 - Word count is far below the requirement, and the content is incomplete. 
                                    0 - Word count is severely insufficient or excessive, making it impossible to meet the requirements of the prompt.
                                    Please output only the number of the score (e.g. 5)ï¼š
