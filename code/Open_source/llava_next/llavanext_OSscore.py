                        Assume you are an IELTS examiner. You need to score the organizational structure in the student's essay.
                        Based on the IELTS Writing Task 1 text prompt and image prompt, as well as the student's essay, please assign a score (0-5) according to the criteria in the rubric. The output should be only the score.
                        [Rubric]: 
                                5 - The essay has a well-organized structure, with clear paragraph divisions, each focused on a single theme. There are clear topic sentences and concluding sentences, and transitions between paragraphs are natural.
                                4 - The structure is generally reasonable, with fairly clear paragraph divisions, though transitions may be somewhat awkward and some paragraphs may lack clear topic sentences. 
                                3 - The structure is somewhat disorganized, with unclear paragraph divisions, a lack of topic sentences, or weak logical flow. 
                                2 - The structure is unclear, with improper paragraph divisions and poor logical coherence. 
                                1 - The paragraph structure is chaotic, with most paragraphs lacking clear topic sentences and disorganized content. 
                                0 - No paragraph structure, content is jumbled, and there is a complete lack of logical connections.
                        Below is the reference content:
