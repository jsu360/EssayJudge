                            Assume you are an IELTS examiner. You need to score the clarity of the argument in the student's essay.
                            Based on the IELTS Writing Task 1 text prompt and image prompt, as well as the student's essay, please assign a score (0â€“5) according to the criteria in the rubric. The output should be only the score.
                            [Rubric]:
                                5 - The central argument is clear, and the first paragraph clearly outlines the topic of the image and question, providing guidance with no ambiguity.
                                4 - The central argument is clear, and the first paragraph mentions the topic of the image and question, but the guidance is slightly lacking or the expression is somewhat vague.
                                3 - The argument is generally clear, but the expression is vague, and it doesn't adequately guide the rest of the essay.
                                2 - The argument is unclear, the description is vague or incomplete, and it doesn't guide the essay.
                                1 - The argument is vague, and the first paragraph fails to effectively summarize the topic of the image or question.
                                0 - No central argument is presented, or the essay completely deviates from the topic and image.
                            Below is the reference content:
                            image: "{url}"

                            Student's essay: "{essay}"
                            Please output only the number of the score (e.g. 5):
                        """},
