Food and drink are part of our daily necessisties, and as a family member grows in number, the more food and drink a family consumed. Over other categories, food and drink are more essential and priority of every residents as the total spending of it increased every fifteen years.

Turning to the first main feature in the first table, a modest 27 students in Germany joined the exchange program to universities in Australia in 2007. The figure for exchange students from Germany to Australia then soared to a precise 62 in 2009. On the other hand, there was a decrease of an exact 5 people in the figure for exchange students from universities in the United Kingdom to universities in Australia, from 31 people in 2007 to 26 people in 2009.

In 2009 the number of exchange students from the United Kingdom and Netherland fell to a modest 23 and 18 respectively. On the contrary, there was a substantial rise of a massive 21 people in the figure for exchange students from France to Australia, from an exact 37 people in 2007 to a precise 58 people in 2009.

This makes possible the exit of the water in excess. Indeed, internal runoff could cause an incontrolled increase of the water level. Thus, the floodgate is very important to mantain stable the level of water. Regardless of the presence of the stopbank, buildings should not touch the ground.

Overall, there are two ways to do this. The first one is using a stopbank. The other one is raising the house under the 100 year flood level. Also we can use a mix of them.
According to the picture, the stopbank is a useful way to prevent flooding by building a little dump between the house and the river. Before constructing it we should know the level of the flood around the previous 100 years and our dump should be higher. Moreover, the stopbank will make an internal pond which will be created by internal runoff, accordingly we should give water to return back to the river via floodgate.
Additionally, it is shown that we could use piles to raise a building above water. In doing this we should carry about 300 mm freeboard between the house flood and the water level.",single_image,flow_chart,4,3,4,4,3.5,3,3,3,3,4

The first diagram depicts how a stopbank acts as a natural barrier to prevent river water from flooding. The stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year-flood level and prevents the drain from overwhelming its banks.

Also, we can notice, that proportion of male and female is almost equal for Indian people. France chart has more complicated structure. The bottom of the chart has square shape, so the the amount of people is almost equal for each group below 35, then chart has shape of triangle as a India chart. Also, there is intresting mark at the top: for group above 85 years old, ""Percent"" of women is several time higher then men. It could be related with wide range of aspects.",single_image,bar_chart,3,3,3,3.5,3,3,3,3,3,3

For example, people aged between 30 and 35 in France have similiar figures to kids aged between 0 and 5. On the other hand, in India children this age are around double that of the adults between 30 and 35. Another importnat difference is that the diagram provides detailed information about the age structure of the population in India only up to 70 years of age, compared to France's which extends to 85.

Overall, just by taking a glance at the chart we can see that the people living in France tend to have a longer lifespan as compared to people living in India, this may be because of better standards of living that are available to French citizens.
The graph representing the Indian population is linear and decreases gradually, with the exception being the senior citizens over the age of 70, while on the other hand, the graph depicting the French citizens is varied, for instance, the graph states that are more people under the age group of 30-35 as compared to 25-30, a similar pattern can be observed when we look at the people under the age group 50-55 versus people under the age group of 45-50.

When the wool is free of dirt there comes the process of drying, during which the water will be vapored out of the wool. Dried wool has to underwent spinning process from which we will receive a wool and a string. The string is recycled and from the wool, the tufts will be made.

Besides, dried wool is sent onto the spinning step, which creates wool. The spinning process also produces string, which is mainly reused. Tufts of wool which is made by crossing wools are delivered into tuft storage. A tuft of wool which is picked up is formed into a round shape, which is called balls of yarn.

After we finish the spinning process, we break them into two productions which are wool and string. The string production can be recycled while the wool can be made into tufts of wool and put them in the tuft of storage.

Right afterward, the mixture goes into a pipe system, where a condensation process takes place, thanks to a condenser that uses cold water. In doing so, the cold water flowing in the condenser absorbs the heat that comes from the pipe where the oil and water solution is.

The process can be outlined in eight consecutive steps, beginning with the manufacturing of the concrete canvas and culminating with storing of goods.
Firstly, the concrete canvas is produced as a three-layers composite. It consists of a fibrous top surface, a layer of dry concrete, and a waterproof layer. The features of each layer play different roles in later usage in terms of ductility and stability. The finished product of the concrete canvas is then packaged in boxes and delivered by truck to the construction site, where the boxes are unwrapped, and the canvas inside is taken out.
In the next stage, the concrete canvas is spread by means of a rope drawn by a vehicle. In order to fix the canvas on the ground, pegs are used and hammered every ten meters along each side of the canvas. After that, on one end of the spread canvas, a door is installed as the entrance of the storage. The covered space between the canvas and the underground is then pumped up and expanded with the aid of a blower machine. Following that, water is sprinkled over the surface of the swollen canvas and reacted with dry concrete with the aim of generating a hard shell for storage. Thus, the form of storage is constructed. After a set period of around 20 to 24 hours, the storage can be put into use.",single_image,flow_chart,3.5,4,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,5

First of all, the most striking information is that China appears to be the main country in which pollution is highly present, in the 3 different areas, during the given period. In fact, their levels of pollution ranged between 60 to 80 PPM, and none of the other countries even reached 60 PPM in terms of pollution during 2021.

However, although China showed again the highest level of transport pollution with 70 PPM, America was not very far from that figure as it was just under 60 PPM, while Japan was half, and Australia did not even reach 20 PPM.
Finally, industry pollution in China was even bigger than the other areas, as it reached the highest point with 80 PPM.

Fist of all, the most striking information is that women were largely more present in languages and painting courses than men, and that the vast majority of the participants in the overall courses were 50 years old or over.
To begin with, it is clearly demonstrated that there were more women than men in all courses, except in sculture. In fact, men attended to language and drama courses were twice as less than women. Women were 40 in language courses and 20 in drama. Men were also slightly less in paiting, around 25 people, compared to women who were 30 at this course. However, in sculpture, men tended to be more present, as they were 10, which is roughly the double of the number of women who were present.
Secondly, there was a marked tendence for people aged from 50 and over to attend a these courses, as they were slighlty more than two fifth.

In 2010, there is a big change in the whole life style which truly impact on families and their ways of spending money. First of all, buying food is quite important as original source for people energy, it has taken the largest amount in exactly 34%.And because many wives become worker, the need to buy ready meals become more necessary than before. Also, it is clear that transportation is almost nearly equal.
As to what has shown there is rapidly decreasing in housing's spending in 2010,and this is justified by the completely change of life in using less and simple thing instead of using expensive and too much staff, and also select smaller house rather than bigger ones. Moreover most families prefer to spend money on their pleasure and joyful life. It is noticed that other spending has jumped sharply from 4% to 19.2% which means people are turning to be consumers.

The use of hand sanitizers has been one of them, but what is it made of? Ethanol is a common disinfecting agent found in cleaning products, which originates from corn. Here's a nine-step manufacturing method of how this alcohol is produced from that supercrop.
In the first third of production, the maize is harvested, stored and ground up during milling. First, farmers collect ripened ears from fields, and then place them in bins and other containers. These are then crushed into a powder to increase the surface area, hence increasing the potential yield of ethanol created.
Steps four to six involve boiling, brewing and filtration. The powder produced in the milling process is mixed with water and boiling takes four hours. Once it is done, the mixtue is left to stand for 48 hours, allowing fermentation to occur, and unprocessed ethanol be created. After this two-day step, the mixture is filtered to separate the unpurified ethanol from the solid by-product.
Lastly, the liquid raw product is distilled, packaged in various containers and shipped to retailers. Filtration is carried out for five hours to increase the purity of the ethanol. Afterwards, the final product is packaged and stored until it is transported to stores, where we can purchase it for our daily use and protection.

The part with a small pond and a couple of sitting banks remains its initial usage for leisure, but its size has been slightly reduced. Furthermore, two new lawn parts have been created. While the one suited in the bottom right-hand corner is available for sports activities like football, the other one lying the opposite of it is applicable for picnics and barbecues with friends and family members.",multi_image,map,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5

1.4 million years ago, the three displayed examples of sharp gadgets used for cutting show a dimensional scene of how the tool was innovated. The narrow view of the side angle explain the fact that such tool was an efficient one. With a length of almost 10cm, it was quiet frankly enough to tear any rigid object it encounters. One unconsidered point, is how the front and the back sides were not as thin and skinny as effective as the side angle. But not as essential. The side angle must be designed potentially thin, in case any hard object required a greater sharpness and strength.
In the following 6 million years, the design showed a dramatic change. The whole views had encountered a modification at some point. The front in addition to the rear hand side views; had displayed no changes if related to the side one.

In general, the high-income group spent much money on hamburger foods which occupy the highest sales on fast foods in the U.K, by 45 pounds per week. Whereas the lowest expenditure on fast foods is pizza approximately 6 pounds a week. In the volume of consumption, there is a rapid rise on fish & chips sales over the period contrary to a continuous reduction on pizza spending in the decades.
To start with the fast-food spending, hamburgers is the highest sales of fast foods per week in the U.K. In the high and average incomes classes, the amount of hamburger sales are the top one in their spending on fast foods, 45 pounds and around 32 pounds a week respectively. Fish & chips spending in the high-income group hits around 16 pounds a week, compared with the spending on pizza almost 19 pounds a week. This is followed by average income classes whose weekly expenditures on fish & chips and pizza are 25 pounds and around 12 pounds individually. Conversely, those with lower income spend much on fish & chips approximately 16 pound a week which is the top one of their fast food costs, compared with hamburgers and pizza which are around 14 pounds and 6 pounds a week.
Going into more detail with regard to the fast-food consumption in gram, there was not significate increase on fish & chips spending in the start of the period. They were a slight rise on its consumption from around 100 grams in 1970 to 150 grams in 1980, followed by a surge in 1985 by 300 grams and a further jump of 200 grams in 1990. The consumption on hamburgers had the same trend with fish & chips over the period. In the beginning, there was a slow upward on purchasing of hamburgers between 1970 and 1985 from around 30 grams to 100 grams. Then, a sharp increase in the consumption of hamburgers was 300 grams in 1990.

To go into detail, there are two countries, in Australia, and Denmark where teachers' annual income reached the maximum salary within 10 years. Specifically, The annual income started at 28,000, 45,000 in Australia, and Denmark respectively. Afterwards, the salaries reached 48,000, 54,000 within 9 years, and 8 years in Australia and Denmark.
When it comes to other three countries, Luxembourg, Japan, and Korea, those three countries teachers steadily increased their annual income, however, they kept working after 15 years and reach maximum later. In Japan, and Korea, their annual income gradually increase the longer they worked. For example, the first years' annual income in each country is 34,000, 30,000 in Japan, and Korea respectively. After 15 years, their incomes soared to 65,000 and 48,000. As a result, their maximum income will reach the peak of 37 years, and 34 years in Japan, and Korea. The salary is 86,000, 64,000 in Japan, and Korea.
Interestingly, in Luxembourg, the annual saralies start at 80,000 and increased to 119,000 after 15 years. In contract, there is not so huge gap between after 15 years annual income and maximum.

Another feature is ratio between starting salary and maximum one. In all the considered countries this ratio exceeds one and a half (in Japan and Korea it is even greater than two), except Denmark, where it is approximately equal to 1.2.

Second, there is a gap in the years that teachers need to teach before obtaining the maximum salary.
On the one hand, the starting salaries of teachers in the selected countries are slightly different. Luxemburg teachers reach the highest starting salary, equal to 80,000. Instead, in Australia, there are the least paid teachers, they have less than 30,000 per year. There is an enormous discrepancy between Luxemburg, in which the starting salaries are the highest ones, and the other countries. Although Denmark is the second country in giving higher salaries, the money teachers reach the first years of teaching is 45.000.
On the other hand, another discrepancy concerns the years that a teacher has to teach before reaching the maximum salary. Indeed, despite being the least-paid teachers, Australians obtain the maximum salary after 9 years of teaching and obtain 48.000 per year. Instead, Luxemburg requires 30 years of work to give teachers the maximum salary, which is also the highest among the countries, and corresponds to 130.000.

Here we see that majority of both managers and secretaries believe the courses are important for the job; about 84% of Secretaries and just around 76% of managers. It makes sense then that only few of these groups of people think the courses are a waste of time (almost 10% for secretaries and just above 10% for managers).
Exactly 50% of managers believe the courses are good for net working while a smaller percentage of secretaries, about 43%, are of the same opinion. A good number still believe the courses provide a good excuse for a change - about 66% for Managers and just shy of 65% for Secretaries.",multi_image,composite_chart,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,4,4,3,4

Those were measured by British thermal Units.
By and large, the consumption and production of energy in the U.S.A. grew strongly over the period from 35 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to approximately 90 quadrillion Btu in 2000 and from 25 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to 65 quadrillion Btu in 2000 respectively. There are a prediction in energry consumption reaching 135 quadrillion Btu in 2025 and 75 quadrillion Btu in energy production.
The first detail to note is that the consumption and production of engery rose steadily over the period. They were significant fluctuation at the start of the period but had risen to around 50 quadrillion Btu in 1975. This was followed by the another fluctuation between 1975 and 2000 and recovered by nearly 90 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption in 2000 and 65 quadrillion Btu in energy production.
The amount of energy consumption in the United States is projected to remain much higher and will be increased as much as energy production overall.

Following energy consumption and production in the US from 1950 to 2000 we can draw several conclusions.
Firstly, the US consumed more energy than it produced from beginning to end. And the number of necessary import is only growing.
So according to outlook for 2025 the difference between produced and requare energy will constitute about 50 quadrillion of British thermal units.
Secondly, bouth of these parameteres are increasing at an incredible rate. At 1950th the US produced about 25 quadrillion of BUT's and consumed about the same. The graph shows that the production almost tripled, when the consumption even beats it.
The most comparable this parameters was at 1970th. Then the requared import didn't exceed 10 quadrillion of BUT's.

Secondly,the small wavs had low output since its for the small waves, in addition it also had low installation costs because its smaller.in the other hand the large waves had high output and high installation costs since its also large.

In particular, there are two different input. From the top the air flow comes into the upper chamber and moves the turbines, that are connected with the electricity generator. At the same time, thanks to the sea waves, the water level rises and with the air flow move the turbines activating the generator.
In the second diagram, we can see that the two location options are related to the output of the produced energy.

Offsprings emerge from the eggs in a form of small fish form which are then reared in the freshwater before they enter the estuary. After a certain period of time, the fish change their habitation to estuary which is the entrance from river to ocean. Then, they completely inhabit the ocean environment, followed by a migration to rearing areas.

The first stage of the salmon starts in the river, where the spawning of two mature salmons lead to the laying of eggs. The rivers have long been chosen by salmons for breeding spots because their fresh-saltless water is suitable for the eggs and the freshly hatched baby salmons to start maturing in. After emerging from the eggs, the hatchlings stay on in the fresh water till they pre-mature/partially grow. After gaining considerable size and adapting to the primary waters, they travel to the estuaries, the only stop-over between them and the oceans. Only the first of the young salmons to reach the estuaries are able to make it to the oceans. This is because once these small and stagnant water bodies get over-crowded, there is virtually no space left in them which in-turn leads to the death of many young salmons.
The young salmons who were able to survive the estuaries journey to the oceans, where the salty water increases their size and makes them fully grown. After getting the maturity to breed, they go back to the rivers from where the cycle starts all-over again.

The process of incresment of acidity (or low pH values) are subjected to a strong variation in the 40 minutes occurring after sweet foods are eaten. The risk that a tooth decay occurs is high mostly if you eat cane sugar.
Before eating sweet foods the level of pH is neutral. 5 minutes after sugar has been eaten, the situation is radically different. The level of pH plummet down, around 3,5 if you eat cane sugare. After 5 minutes the level of pH arrives at the maximum of the acidity level that can be caused by sugar. Then, the level of pH starts deacreasing slowly again and after 30 minutes (if cane sugar had been eaten) or a little bit less (20-25 minutes) if honey or fruit sugar had been eaten, the acidity is almost normal (between 6 and 7).
The risk that a tooth decay occurs are very high, mostly if the the sweet product eaten is cane sugar. Instead, the possibility that a problem like tooth decay arise is very low if honey had been eaten. Specifically, the minutes under risk are just 15 if you had eaten honey and more that 30 if you had chosen cane sugar. A tooth decay can occur when the level of pH is lower that 5.5. Then, the acidity of honey remains always lower that that of cane sugar and for this reason the risky minutes are lower.",single_image,line_chart,4,4,3,3,3,3.5,3,3,3,4

This entails the passage of water through electric heaters, followed by transfer to a carbon dioxide formation machine via a cooling pipe. Subsequently, the carbonated liquid is conveyed to a mixing tank, where it is blended with colouring, syrup, and flavour. Following this, the effervescent water undergoes filtration and is then dispensed into bottles and cans. Ultimately, the packaged refreshment beverages are transported via trucks to supermarkets or directly delivered to residential areas.

After pumping, mixture of water and chemicals are transferred to an electrical heater, for heating. After heating, water is moved to the chamber by a pipe which is known as a cooling pipe, to cool down the temperature. On one side of chamber, cooling pipe is connected, while on another end an inlet is present that help in entry of carbon dioxide. This help in formation of the carbonated water.

This carbonated water is conveyed to a tank known as mixing tank. This tank have three different sub chambers in it, one is for colouring, another is for flavouring and in between of these two a box is present containing the specific kind of syrup.

At its core, the process depends entirely on sheep, as their fleece serves as the starting point for all woolen goods.

First off, sheep are sheared to collect their fleece. This raw fleece is then cleaned to get rid of any dirt or impurities. Once cleaned, the fleece becomes what we commonly refer to as wool. At this point, the wool is assessed for quality to determine its end use.

The next part is interesting; the wool gets spun into yarn. This yarn is then woven or knitted into fabrics. These fabrics are the raw materials for making clothes like sweaters, hoodies, and jackets. Generally, two methods are used for this: hand-knitting and mass production.

If the wool doesn't make the quality cut, it's not wasted. It gets recycled into lower-grade wool products, so nothing goes to waste.

In summary, the journey of wool from sheep to shop involves several crucial steps. Each stage plays a role in determining the quality and type of the final product.",single_image,flow_chart,4,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5

Stopbank consist of freeboard, berm and floodgate. If the area have the stopbank as a barrier between the river and an accomdation site near it, this prevent the water to enter in the housing sites. If the level of 100-year flood level is quite high, however, due to the presence of this technology, the water in housing colonies is quite low, which will prevent from flooding.

In contrast, if stopbank is not present, the level of water on the riverside is identical to the side of land area.

The stopbank was made to stop the water flowing back in the lowest area where houses and buildings had been located. In addition, floodgate had been placed on ground level near the river, this helps water flowing through the pipe and is released to a large water source.

The first diagram details the internal mechanics of the wave-energy machine, while the second diagram compares the advantages and disadvantages of different installation sites.

The wave-energy machine operates by harnessing the movement of waves to generate electricity. As waves enter the machine, they cause water levels in the chambers to rise and fall. This movement forces air to flow through a turbine, which is connected to an electricity generator. The bidirectional air flow, facilitated by the water levels' fluctuations, powers the turbine, thereby generating electricity.

The second diagram discusses the two primary location options for wave-energy machines: areas with large waves and areas with small waves. Installing the machine in areas with large waves results in high energy output due to the greater force of the waves. However, these locations come with high installation costs.

Thereafter, the water returns back to the sea with the help of a nearby drain.

Following this, the second diagram provides information about dependence of the range and price of the installation on the output power of the wave-energy machine. Thus, the further away from the shore the machines are located, the more power will be generated from the waves.

As the water level rises, an upward flow of air is created, which allows the air to circulate throughout the machine when combined the downward air. This spins the turbines in the compartment above the water chamber, which activates the electricity generator.

On the upper side, the cold air will flow through a designated entrance, which later causes the turbine to move and produces hot wind as the outcomes that is driven outside the machine. Concurrently, the machine also receives energy from the wave beneath it. The strong current that successfully reaches the underwater chamber causes the level of collected water rises until it creates a strong hot air flow that will move the turbine, which produces cold air that is released back to the underwater chamber.

Regarding its location, there are two options to install the machine. First, it can be placed close to the seashore, with a low installation cost.

Overall, after looking at the various steps of this procedure, it can be plainly seen that this process is circular. Additionally, there are two proposed locations that differ in the cost of installation and the amount of the produced energy.

In the beginning, regarding the generation process,  water waves go through a hole within that machine in a certain direction,and an airflow enters via an upper entrance, simultaneously. Next, the airflow along with the water goes through a turbine. Then, the turbine transmits the power that is created by both the water and air to the electricity generator. Finally, the electrical power is generated.

To be more detailed, when the water levels rise due to the wave direction, the airflow goes up through the first turbine. Subsequently, the second turbine will be passed by the water, but before that, the flow undergoes the electricity generator in order to produce the electricity. Finally, the airflow turns out to the opposite direction in order to cycle the process from the beginning step.

The skirt is attached to the basket using ropes, and the burner hangs above the basket. Inside the basket are propane tanks which are used to power the burner.

Regarding the function of the hot air balloon, the burner combines regular air with propane to heat the air trapped inside the envelope, which then becomes lighter and thus makes the balloon buoyant.

On the contrary, in the case of the Indians, the number started at 15 in 1950, and next, the percentage increased, and subsequently, the proportion is said to grow to nearly 20 after 100 years.

According to the demographic examination of the USA, the statistics presented there were over 5 million Americans in 1950. After that, it dropped to 5 million until 2002. In addition, the number is reported to remain the same after 48 years.",single_image,bar_chart,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,3,3,3.5

At the outset of the period, Japan°Øs population was 84.1 million; however, the figure climbed steadily to about 127 million, in half a decade. This figure stayed fairly the same within the next 15 years. Additionally, over 65 year olds contributed to about 5% of the total population in 1950. This figure quadrupled by 2005.

When looking into the projections, it seems like Japanese population is predicted to fall throughout the upcoming years. In 2035, the figure would be 110 million, and in 2055, it would have fallen by 20 million. Although the total number of Japanese is projected to decline, the number of senior citizen is expected to double from 20% (in 2005) to 40% (in 2055).",multi_image,composite_chart,3.5,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4

Overall, an increasing trend was noted in the Japanese populace during the twentieth century. Although the population size has remained constant in the early twenty-first century, it is expected to follow a downward course in future. In contrast, the elderly population has been shown to rise in the past and will continue to hike in the future as well.

The population of Japan was around 85 million, to begin with in 1950. A gradual increase in the size of the population was observed till 1990, when it reached to 125 million, with an average hike of around 5% every five years. From 1995 till 2005, the volume of the populace stayed almost constant and the number of people peaked in 127.8 million. In future, however, the total number of the people is expected to plunge to a figure of 89 million in 2055. This drop in population over next 50 years is expected to be consistent with the rise in the people size in the twentieth century.

On the other hand, a constant hike in the statistic of the elderly people (aged 65yrs and above) is noted. They comprised of only 5% of the total populace in 1950 (4 million).

The diagram outlines the sequential stages of hydroelectric power generation, starting from the reservoir and intake, moving through the penstock, turbine, and generator in the powerhouse, and ending with the transmission of electricity through long-distance power lines. It also depicts the return of water to the river after passing through the turbine.

Initially, water from the reservoir is directed through the intake and into the penstock under high pressure, subsequently reaching the turbine. The kinetic energy produced by the turbine is then converted into electricity by the generator within the powerhouse. Following this stage, the electricity is transmitted through cables to distant locations, highlighting the efficiency and reach of hydroelectric power.

Moreover, it is noteworthy that hydroelectric power generation is eco-friendly, as it does not produce harmful byproducts and relies solely on the natural forces of water. Additionally, the process is sustainable due to the continuous replenishment of water through the natural water cycle, ensuring an ongoing renewable energy source.

A hydroelectric dam is using water to generate electricity. It can be a long and complicated process, however the diagram clearing breaks down the main processes to produce electricity.

Firstly, the construction of a large dam is required. A dam is a manmade body of water, if large enough can turn into a reservoir. The water from the reservoir is forced through an intake. It then flows down a small narrow tunnel called a penstock, causing an increase of pressure, which as a result makes the turbine spin.

After that, the access water leaves through a wider passageway, and into a river. While, the turbine spinning converts into electricity. This electricity is created through the generator within the powerhouse. The electricity formed exits the powerhouse via small wires and cables where it can be used over long distances.

With this process, there is no harmful byproducts created, as it just during hydrostatic pressure from the water to produce electricity. As the water exits via the river, it means that this process is renewable. However, the creation of the dam can cause short term negative effects, as during the construction of the dam, there can be loss of habitat and a damaged ecosystem during this process.",single_image,flow_chart,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5

The turbine is connected to a generator in the powerhouse above, and this is where the movement of the turbine is converted into electricity. The resulting electricity leaves the powerhouse via cables that carry it over long distances to where it can be used.
